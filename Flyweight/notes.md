Avoid redundancy when storing data 
eg instead of strong the same identical data in many places, store reference for it 
or bold/italic, store ranges instead of all characters

saves memory

Store common data externally
specify an index ir a reference to external data store
define the idea of ranges on homogenous collections and store the ranges
